Compiling
~~~~~~~~~

Install with
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   sudo make install

By default this installs plugins in /usr/local/lib/ladspa.  If
you want them to go somewhere else, configure cmake accordingly
by running 'ccmake .'

You should set the environment variable LADSPA_PATH to contain the
path to the plugins, so they can be found.  Something like this:

export LADSPA_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ladspa:/usr/lib/ladspa

You probably want to put this in your ~/.bashrc or some such.


Platform-specific issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code sets flags in the floating point processor, so that denormal floating
point numbers don't cause a performance hit, should they occur.  This is
platform-specific, and requires compiling with -msse2 -mfpmath=sse.  So far as
I know, these instruction sets are only implemented on Intel and Athlon
processors.  Compiling for other architectures will probably require some
changes to the source code.

You can set USE_SSE2 to off using ccmake if you do not want to use SSE2.
