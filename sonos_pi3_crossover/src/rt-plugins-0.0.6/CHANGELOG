## [0.0.6] - 2017-01-04

  * src/*.c: put 'set_run_adding_gain = NULL' in all plugins for compatibility
    with some LADPSA hosts; thanks to John Rigg
  * CMakeLists.txt: change "_BSD_SOURCE" (deprecated in gcc) to "_DEFAULT_SOURCE"
  * cleanup: delete cmake-generated files before packaging
  * src/RTdecorrmls.c: new (undocumented) stereo decorrelation by convolution
    with mls signals

## [0.0.5] - 2016-03-07

  * : build cleanup; thanks to Daniel Guermeur.  No code changes.

## [0.0.4] - 2015-08-11

	* : move to cmake for build management, plus folder re-restructuring and
    code cleanups, all thanks to Florian Franzmann
	* include/biquad.h, src/RTlowpass1.c, src/RThighpass1.c: implement first-order
    low- and high-pass filters
	*	maxima/: maxima code for deriving biquad/bilin coefficients via bilinear transform
	* testing/: R code to measure and plot magnitude/phase responses of all filters,
    plus measure distortion (due e.g. to quantization of coefficients)

## [0.0.3] - 2013-09-02

	* Makefile: remove -march=native because it breaks the build on RPi
	* biquad.h, RTallpass1.c, RTallpass2.c: use factoring to reduce floating-
		point multiplications for allpass filters

## [unreleased] - 2013-07-14

	* biquad.h, RTallpass2.c: use Q instead of bw to parametrize 2nd-order allpass

## [unreleased] - 2013-07-11

	* biquad.h: make 1st-order allpass non-inverting

## [0.0.2] - 2013-06-25

	* biquad.h, *.c: remove DAZ/FTZ denormal handling so we can build for ARM;
		instead add a low-level (-360dB) square-wave at the Nyquist frequency
		as a denormal killer
	* Makefile: remove SSE2 stuff so we can build for ARM
