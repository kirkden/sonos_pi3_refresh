The scripts here, written in the R language (www.r-project.org) are for testing the plugins.

ladspa_testing.R: measure (via mls techniques) the magnitude and phase response of every plugin in the collection.

distortion_test.R: put a test signal through one of the plugins, and plot the spectrum 

PRE-REQUISITES:

Install ecasound and sox (for dither):

> sudo apt-get install sox ecasound

Install R libraries "tuneR", "sound" and "fftw".  From the R command-line:

> install.packages( c( "tuneR", "fftw", "sound" ) )

If the "sound" library is no longer in the repositories, grab an archived version from here:

https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/sound/sound_0.6-1.tar.gz

then do

> R CMD INSTALL sound_0.6-1.tar.gz

You also need to compile the code needed for mls signal generation and de-convolution:

> R CMD SHLIB mls.c
